This is the first project that I created in Wes Bos's JavaScript30 Challenge! It's a keyboard drum kit that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are buttons displayed on the web page that are labeled with letters. When you click the corresponding letter on your keyboard, a drum sound will play and the on-screen button will become highlighted with a glowing yellow border. It's pretty neat! Go ahead and try it out for yourself.
